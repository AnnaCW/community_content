## Overview

Each six-week session, all students in modules 2, 3, and 4 will prepare either a lightning talk, blog post for turing.io/blog, screencast for turing.io/blog, or student-led elective. Preparation and completion of any of these options will take approximately 2-4 hours. 

Alternatively, students may pitch and lead a Gear-Up session. Check with both Jeff and Allison to get this approved. 

## Community Content How-To

Choose a topic and a format (ie - Animation with Snap.js, lightning talk). Topics cannot be repeated during the module and are first come, first serve. During the week you are assigned to community content, the schedule is as follows: 

* **Monday**: Submit your topic and format to the markdown file **before 4pm**. 
* **Tuesday**: Add your outline as a gist **before 4pm**.
* **Wednesday**: Draft slides and/or content. You do not need to submit anything.
* **Thursday**: Rehearsal in Classroom C after wrap up. Your slides and/or content should be prepared in advance as laptops will be closed during rehearsal. Attendance is mandatory. 
* **Friday**: Present your 5-minute talk or student-led session for your Turing peers OR send your blog post or screen cast to Allison to post on the Turing blog. 

## Topics & Themes

All topics must be approved 

**Module 2 students**: It is preferred that your topic fit into one of the themes below. That said, feel free to pitch a topic related to your experience prior to Turing. Keep in mind that the topic should be of interest to a school of software developers and that the topic must be approved before moving forward. 

**Module 3 and 4 students**: Your topic should fit into one of the themes below:

* Computer Hardware
* Computer Science
* Design / User Experience
* DevOps
* Front End Development
* General Software Methodologies / Techniques
* Historical or Present-day People in Computer Science
* JavaScript Architecture / Libraries
* Programming & Science
* Programming & the Arts
* Programming Languages
* Ruby Architecture / Libraries
* Software Libraries
* Software Testing
* Technology & Law
* Technology & Society
* Technology & Ethics
* Web Technologies

When considering the content of your presentation, take care to promote a welcoming environment for all students regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic background, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. 

## Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec" is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.
